# 🎯 Voice-Assisted Object Detection using YOLOv3  

This project utilizes **YOLOv3** for real-time object detection and integrates **text-to-speech (TTS)** functionality to provide **audio feedback** about detected objects. It helps visually impaired individuals by describing objects in their surroundings.  

## 📌 Features  
- 🎥 **Real-time object detection** using YOLOv3.  
- 🔊 **Voice output** describing detected objects with **gTTS**.  
- 🎨 **Bounding box visualization** with object labels.  
- 🚀 **Playsound integration** for instant voice feedback.  

## 🛠️ Requirements  
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:  

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python playsound gtts pydub matplotlib scikit-learn
