Voice-Assisted Object Detection using YOLOv3

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements a real-time object detection system using YOLOv3 and provides voice feedback describing detected objects' locations in the frame. The system captures live video using a webcam, processes frames through YOLOv3, and generates audio descriptions using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).

ðŸŽ¯ Features

Real-Time Object Detection: Uses YOLOv3 for accurate and fast object detection.

Voice Feedback: Converts detected objects' descriptions into speech.

Dynamic Location Identification: Specifies whether objects are on the left, center, or right, as well as top, middle, or bottom.

Automatic Audio Generation: Saves and plays descriptions as MP3 files.

Optimized Processing: Uses Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to filter overlapping detections.

ðŸš€ Installation & Setup

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.x). Install the following dependencies:

pip install numpy opencv-python playsound gtts pydub matplotlib

Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/voice-object-detection.git
cd voice-object-detection

Download YOLOv3 Weights

Download the pre-trained YOLOv3 model weights:

wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights

Ensure the following files are in the project directory:

yolov3.cfg

yolov3.weights

coco.names

ðŸ›  Usage

Run the following command to start object detection with voice assistance:

python detect.py

How It Works

Captures Frames: Captures live frames from the webcam every 60 frames.

Processes Image: Uses YOLOv3 to detect objects and their bounding boxes.

Determines Location: Identifies objects' positions within the frame.

Generates Voice Output: Converts object details into speech and plays it.

Keyboard Shortcuts

Press 'q' to exit the application.

ðŸ“Œ Example Output

When a person and a chair are detected in different positions, the voice output might be:

You have in front of you: bottom left person, top right chair.

ðŸ”§ Customization

Modify coco.names to detect specific objects.

Adjust confidence threshold (confidence > 0.5) in the script for different accuracy levels.

Change frame capture rate to process frames at different intervals.

ðŸ›  Troubleshooting

Ensure yolov3.weights, yolov3.cfg, and coco.names are in the working directory.

Install missing dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
